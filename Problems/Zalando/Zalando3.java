/**
 * Question Provider : Codility
 * <p>
 * A zero-indexed array 'a' consisting of 'n' integers is given.
 * The elements of array 'a' together represent a chain,
 * and each element represents the strength of each link in the chain.
 * We want to divide this chain into three smaller chains.
 * <p>
 * All we can do is to break the chain in exactly two non-adjacent positions.
 * More precisely, we should break links P, Q (0 < P < Q < N - 1, Q - P > 1),
 * resulting in three chains [0, P - 1], [P + 1, Q - 1], [Q + 1, N - 1].
 * The total cost of this operation is equal to a[P] + a[Q].
 * <p>
 * For example, consider array 'a' such that:
 * <p>
 * a[0] = 5
 * a[1] = 2
 * a[2] = 4
 * a[3] = 6
 * a[4] = 3
 * a[5] = 7
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * We can choose to break the following links:
 * <p>
 * (1, 3): total cost is 2 + 6 = 8
 * (1, 4): total cost is 2 + 3 = 5
 * (2, 4): total cost is 4 + 3 = 7
 * <p>
 * Write a function:
 * that, given a zero-indexed array 'a' of 'n' integers, returns the minimal cost of dividing chain into three pieces.
 * <p>
 * For example, given:
 * <p>
 * a[0] = 5
 * a[1] = 2
 * a[2] = 4
 * a[3] = 6
 * a[4] = 3
 * a[5] = 7
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * the function should return 5, as explained above.
 * <p>
 * Assume that:
 * <p>
 * 'n' is an integer within the range [ 5.. 100,000];
 * each element of array 'a' is an integer within the range [ 1.. 1,000,000,000].
 * <p>
 * Complexity:
 * <p>
 * expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);
 * expected worst-case space complexity is O(N),
 * beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).
 * <p>
 * Elements of input arrays can be modified.
